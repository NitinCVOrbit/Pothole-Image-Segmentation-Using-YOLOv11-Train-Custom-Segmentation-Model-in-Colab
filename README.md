## 🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform **Pothole Image Segmentation** using the latest **YOLOv11 segmentation** model in Google Colab.

You will learn:
- Automated dataset download using `gdown`
- Preparing YOLO-formatted dataset folders
- Creating segmentation YAML file
- Training YOLOv11-Seg model
- Visualizing segmentation masks with transparency
- Running inference on test images
